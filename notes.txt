workflow_run:
	Runs once for each of the `on.workflow_run.workflows`, not just once after all
	Can use `fountainhead/action-wait-for-check` to wait for checks to finish first
		Each job, even if multiple are specified in a file, uses its job_id as the checkName
		So you can have both the waiting and the dependencies in the same workflow file
